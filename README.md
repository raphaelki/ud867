# Gradle for Android and Java

4th project of Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.

This project is about customization of gradle builds and inclusion of android and java libraries in a project.
A Google Cloud Endpoint is used to provide jokes to the client application. Also, there are two product flavors, a "free" flavor which shows an ad before displaying the joke and a "paid" flavor which does not.
